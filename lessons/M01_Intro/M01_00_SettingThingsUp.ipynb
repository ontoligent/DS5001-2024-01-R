To find out which branch you are in, do `git branch`; this will show you all of your branches with an asterisk by the one you are in. To get into the <tt>main</tt> repo, do `git checkout main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To work on the notebooks in the repo without altering the state of the main branch, you will create new branches wherein you may do your work. To create a new branch for your work do this `git checkout -b m01`, assuming you are working on Module 1. You can follow this pattern for all of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can commit changes from within your branch and push it to your forked repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Note you don't need to merge the main branch with your working branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that there are other ways to do this:**\n",
